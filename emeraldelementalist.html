        <p>Created in universe 805-7f3o4a, Emerald is the most recent addition ot the Dimension Defenders. Emerald has a strong sense of honor and lives to serve the common people to the best of their abilities. They also are "afflicted" by a powerful corruption that was thought to only affect humans. Though infected, Emerald seems to not experience any of the mind withering effects and has actually tapped into its magic nature allowing them to cast some earth based magics. They are fasinated by the various hobbies of every universe tehy visit and are still striving to find answers to what existence truly is.</p>
