        <p>Created in universe 805-7f3o4a, Emerald is the most recent addition ot the Dimension Defenders. Emerald has a strong sense of honor and lives to serve the common people to the best of their abilities. They also are "afflicted" by a powerful corruption that was thought to only affect humans. Though infected, Emerald seems to not experience any of the mind withering effects and has actually tapped into its magic nature allowing them to cast some earth based magics. They are fasinated by the various hobbies of every universe tehy visit and are still striving to find answers to what existence truly is.</p>

      <div class="creation">
        <h3 id="createheader">Creation</h3>
        <p>Emerald was created as a Warforge-class construct for in the heart of the Empire. They were originally programmed with limited emotional capability and a clothing recognition program to prevent any rogue, off-duty orders. Emerald's core body is comprised mostly of magically infused wood and iron struts outlining armor installation areas. Designed for combat, Emerald was immediately enlisted to assist in the defense of key archipelago. While stationed there, they were quickly made the quarter master of Company 17. The other soldiers noted that Unit 7F-E0A4 was "...somehow greener and shinier than the new recuits..." and took to calling them Emerald.</p>

      <div class=corruption>
        <h3 id="corruptionheader">The Corruption</h3>
        <p>Emerald's nickname soon became an ill-omen. Company 17 had caught word of location on the island that seemed to be releasing "The Corruption", a deadly, mind-altering, crstyalizing infection that affected only humans, as per the curse that started it long ago. Being one of the only non-human members of company 17, Emerald was sent to investigate. No one, not even Emerald is quite sure how but they returned heaily afflicted by the corruption.
