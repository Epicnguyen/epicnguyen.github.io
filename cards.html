              <h3>My Gripe:</h3>
              <p>My Dad has 3 decks of playing cards each themed around one of the original Star Wars movies. Each card in the deck showcases a scene from the movie, and had fairly iconic Star Wars styling to it, but I had some problems with the deck. For starters, the scenes were just kinda slapped on with wild abandon; no two cards of the same value or the same suit had remotely similar scenes. In addition, the characters for the card's value were very small and easy to miss, and each deck felt the need to use non-standard colors for the corner pips like blue and green. So basically as soon as you drew a card it took you a moment to figure out what the card was. </p>
              <p>So I decided to make my own playing card deck that remidies these problems. I was getting really passionate about character design, so I wanted to make a deck of popular characters whose outfits I redesigned to fit the suit they function for. I also decided each suit should have a theme, so hearts were loving and caring characters, clubs were wild and random characters, diamonds were harsh and lethal, and spades were smart and witty. Futhermore, I decided that a character chosen for a card HAD to relate to the card's value in some way as well. So, Ben 10 is obviously a 10 card but Spider-man is an 8 because spiders have eight legs. I will admit some stretched further than others, but I also didn't let the challenge end there, to be fair. I also wanted those that got a 4 of a kind to be rewarded with a fun scene of some sort, to insentivise holding on to your three-of-a-kind and also to give the deck more cohesion. The result is this beautiful deck that I spent about 6 months designing. Here are just some highlights of it.</p>
