    <h2 id="originheader">Origins</h2>
    <h4>A Mission from God</h4>
      <p> Saved from the brink of death, <b>Vistra Lutgehr</b> found herself in the presence of the very god she had served to her last breath, <i>The Lord of Light</i>. Calling itself Migoria, the Lord of Light commissioned Vistra to assemble a team of the champions from across the multiverse to combat instances that would threaten the existence of its many universes.<br> After much study, Vistra found that she could only survvey the various worlds, as inter dimension travel wore on her greatly. No sooner than she had given up had a Sorcerer arrived at her sacntuary looking fro a group of rogue dimension hoopers. The sorcerer was <b>Emma MacLoughlin</b> and she had stated that she had a far easier time traveling the various dimensions and could even bring others with her. After much convincing, Emma agreed to help Vistra in forging a team and was dubbed <i>The Silver Sorcerer</i>. The two have headed the Dimension Defenders recuiting the most powerful heroes of each dimension.<br>

    <h4> The Rules for Determining a Dimension Defender </h4>
      <p>After a horrible experince with <b>Ashnaard</b>, the first <i>Purple Paladin</i>, Vistra and Emma hashed out some hard rules for determing what makes someone worthy of the name <u>Dimension Defender</u>. They are as follows:
        <br>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Must have thwarted at least one superhuman threat</b></li>

          <p>Originally, Vistra's requirement was to have defeated one intergalactic threat, however Emma pointed out that those that have the ability to defeat intergalictic threats single handedly are likely intergalactic threats themselves. After coming to an agreement that the defenders would always be dispatched in teams of two or more, the requirement was revised.</p>

          <li><b>Must have the heart of a hero</b></li>

          <p>Vistra refuses to budge on the wording, but Emma agrees that a Defender must value the lives of those around them at all times.</p>

          <li><b>Must have a color theme</b></li>

          <p>Dispite many Emma's arguements against it vistra not only asserts that this is a requirement but in addition, the color theme must create alliteration with your title. (ie. Silver Sorcerer, Red Ranger, Avocodo Artificer) Vistra constantly says that they must remain "on-brand".</p>
        </ul>
        <p>A champion must satisfy these three requirements to be accepted as a Dimension Defender.</p>
