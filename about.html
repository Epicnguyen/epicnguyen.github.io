          <h2> Character Designer </h2>
          <p> Toan has been interested in designing characters since he was nine years old. He loved thinking of, and writing stories of heroes and pranksters. He would soon begin to design new outfits and costumes for some of his favorite pop culture characters. It wasn't until he was fifteen years old that he started to take character design more seriously; taking a character's needs and personality into consideration as well as color and shape theory when designing outfits. Since his time at FIRST Institute, Toan has learned to take apply his process of character design to logo design and marketing. In a way, he views businesses as characters with a story to be told.</p> <br/>

          <h2>Writer</h2>
          <p>Toan took an interest in writing at the young age of six years old. He would write scripts and plays for him and his siblings to enact. When he was only eight eyars old, he found out that a child his age had published a book, which gave him the goal of publishing his own book. Now after dozens of stories and many failed attempts, Toan has self-published his own book called <i>The Journals of Intergalactic Gladiator, Pocket</i> and his own comic <i>Toan Nation.</i> Toan's passion for writing contiues to grow, and while he has another book series and another comic line in the works, he is eager to find any opportunity to write more stories.</p><br/>

          <h2>Nerd</h2>
          <p>If there's one thing that defines Toan as a person it is nerd. Superhero fan, anime fan, gamer, science head, code monkey, D&D player/Game Master; much of Toan's life is squarely in the nerd category. One thing that Toan also tends to nerd out on is the projects he gets to work on. So maybe Toan can be the nerd for your next project.</p><br/>
