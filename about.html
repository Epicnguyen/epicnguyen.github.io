          <h2> Character Designer </h2>
          <p> Toan has been interestid in designeing characters since he was 9 years old. He loved thinking of and writing stories of heroes and pranksters and would soon begin to design new outfits and costumes for some of his favorite pop culture characters. It wasn't until he was 15 years old that he started to take character design more seriously; taking a character's needs, personality, and color and shape theory into into account when designing outfits. Since his time at FIRST Institute, Toan has learned to take apply his process of character design to logo design and marketing. In a way he views businesses as characters with a story to be told.</p> <br/>

          <h2>Animator</h2>
          <p>Toan took an interest in animation at the young age of 10 years old. Originally it was because he wanted to direct an animated show and believed "I shouldn't try to lead people through things I don't know how to do myself." It wasn't until Toan was 18 that he got the chance to actually try animation, using Adobe Flash. Having published the results, Toan believes that he can still do better and continues to persue opportunities to create more and more enjoyable animations.</p> <br/>

          <h2>Nerd</h2>
          <p>If there's one thing that defines Toan as a person it is nerd. Superhero fan, anime fan, gamer, science head, code monkey, D&D player/Game Master; much of Toan's life is squarely in the nerd category. One thing that Toan also tends to nerd out on is the projects he gets to work on. So maybe Toan can be the nerd for your next project.</p><br/>
