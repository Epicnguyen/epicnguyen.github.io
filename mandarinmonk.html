    <h2 id="overviewheader">Overview</h2>
      <p> Golden Sunrise Drifting River was orphaned at a very young age. Since as early as he can remember he was raised by the monks of K'un-Lun in Universe 616-f37b48. There Golden Sunrise became a master at the martial arts of K'un-Lun and made a reputation for his ever optimistic attitude. Seeking to deepen his training and spread light to the darkest corners of the universe, Golden Sunrise moved to Earth and studied under the <i>Iron Fist</i> of K'un-Lun, Daniel Rand. There he earned the nickname "Sunny" and defended the streets of New York at night, later taking on the alias the <b>Mandarin Monk</b></p>

    <h2 id="earlyheader">Early Years</h2>
      <p> Sunny spent a large portion of his life training in the monastary of K'un-Lun. He trained in the K'un Lun mountain fist and was determined to create his own form that gave reverense to the Lord of Light. Sunny was often belittled both for his alien appearance and his fascination with light and oranges which he believes to be the "fruit of light." Regardless, Sunny always though the best of every person and every situation.
      At the age of nineteen, Sunny's prgress in his unique art style was so prominant that he was asked to become the next Iron Fist and partake in the trial of Shao Lao.</p>
      <br>

    <h2 id="trialheader">Trial of Shao Lao</h2>
      <p> It is tradition for K'un-Lun to create an Iron Fist by sending a warrior to the cave of Shao Lao to defeat the dragon within and dip their fist in the cauldron that holds Shao Lao's molten heart. Sunny, however, took a different path to becoming an Iron Fist. Upon entering the cave, Sunny cherrily greeted the dragon and politely asked if he could get to the cauldron the dragon gaurded. The dragon declined. Then, Sunny bowed and politely said that he would ask again tomorrow.<br>
      For the next year, Sunny visited the dragon and conversed with him, occasionally bring games for them to play together like Xiangqi and checkers. At the end of the year Sunny had built such a deep relationship with Shao Lao that the dragon not only let Sunny into the chaber where his heart was stored, Shao Lao also instructed Sunny to drink from the cauldron instead of simply dipping his hand in. Sunny did as instructed but the taste wasn't to his liking so he was unable to drink a full portion. Having completed the trial, Sunny bid farewell to Shao Lao and wished him well. The monks of K'un-Lun agreed that while Sunny's trial was complete he had become something otherthan an Iron Fist. Unsure of how to train him or what he had become, the monks recommended that Sunny travel to Earth to study under the current Iron Fist, Danny Rand.
